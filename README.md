## Problem Statement

The proliferation of AI-generated deepfakes poses severe threats across multiple domains:

**Rising Deepfake Threats:**
- Deepfakes are increasingly used for misinformation, fraud, impersonation, and breaching law enforcement
- Cybercrime investigations and public safety are compromised
- Corporate environments face employment fraud through "ghost workers" bypassing remote hiring processes

**Limitations of Current Detection Systems:**
- Existing solutions are cloud-dependent, requiring clean video inputs
- Produce non-explainable binary outputs without confidence scoring
- Fail to comprehend context, nuance, or detect sophisticated manipulations

**Real-World Failures:**
- Detection models fail on compressed, re-recorded, or low-quality videos
- Cannot handle real-world scenarios with varying lighting, resolution, and compression
- Corporate impact includes millions lost to deepfake-enabled fraud

## Our Solution: INTERCEPTOR

We propose an **agent-driven deepfake detection system** that addresses the critical gaps in current solutions through intelligent routing and specialized analysis.

### Core Innovation: Agentic Intelligence

Unlike traditional single-model approaches, INTERCEPTOR employs an intelligent agent that:

1. **Fast Initial Screening**: Uses a lightweight baseline model for rapid assessment
2. **Smart Routing**: Escalates uncertain cases to specialist models based on video characteristics
3. **Adaptive Analysis**: Routes videos through appropriate specialists (compression, lighting, audio-visual, resolution, temporal)
4. **Confidence-Aware Processing**: Delivers reliable results with explainable confidence scores
5. **Edge Deployment**: Functions without cloud dependency for real-time verification

### Key Differentiators

**Intelligent Routing vs Static Processing:**
- Current systems process all videos through the same pipeline
- INTERCEPTOR adapts its analysis strategy based on video characteristics
- Saves computational resources while maintaining detection quality

**Multi-Specialist Architecture:**
- Compression Specialist: Detects JPEG artifacts and encoding inconsistencies
- Lighting Specialist: Analyzes illumination patterns in low-light conditions
- Audio-Visual Specialist: Checks lip-sync and audio-visual correlation
- Resolution Specialist: Identifies upsampling and resolution manipulation
- Temporal Specialist: Examines frame-to-frame consistency

**Real-World Robustness:**
- Handles compressed, re-recorded, and low-quality videos
- Works across varying lighting conditions and resolutions
- Provides explainable results with confidence scoring
